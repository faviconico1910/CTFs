### Challenge Description
# It seems harmless at first glance, but could there be something hidden within? ðŸ¤”

Look at the source code, quite simple: 
```
void main()
{
    setvbuf(stdout, 0, 2, 0);
    setvbuf(stdin, 0, 2, 0);
    char buf[0x100];
    char FLAG[] = "FLAG{fake_flag}";
    printf("Enter your input: ");
    scanf("%255s", buf);
    while(1)
    {
        int i;
        printf("Enter the index of the character you want to inspect: ");
        scanf("%d", &i);
        printf("The character at index %d is '%c'.\n", i, buf[i]);
    }
}
```

After a few tries, I realized that if I type in negative index, it still prints out single character, and with -2 index, I have '}', which is the end of our local flag.
This bug is called Out Of Bound.
Therefore, my plan is bruteforce every character. Here is my script:
